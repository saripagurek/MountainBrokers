    <h2>In a company of your size,
       what is your attitude towards your employees?

    <h2>We find that treating our employees with
      respect helps keep our company moving.
      Acknowledging their achievements,and appealing to
      their human sides. Often large corporations get lost, and treat
      their workers like machines,but we think a comfortable
      work environment will make the workers feel even happier
      about the work they are doing.
Our building is filled with
comfortable chairs, and quiet places to work. White boards to
encourage creative ideas, and snacks to keep them going throughout the day.

    <h2>Why did you, as a founder, choose to use Mountains to symbolize
      your company?
    <br/> <h4>-Ashley Vargas (Community User)</h4> </h2></h2>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>We chose to use mountains as our theme and overall concept
       because of what mountains represent. Mountains are large,
       powerful structures that reach new heights. As our goal is to
        reach new heights in the stock market just as mountains reach
         new heights even when struck by plates.

    <h2>How did your company grow to be so large and successful?

    <h2>That is a great question, and we will gladly answer it for you.
       You need to understand the concept of ‘successful’ to become a fully
        functioning company. Let us tell you, we are definitely a large
         and successful company, that much is clear. But as to how we
          became so successful we really looked deep enough to see our
           competitors’ successes and learned and built from there.
            Our success is the foundation of our company and was obtained,
      successfully building our business.
