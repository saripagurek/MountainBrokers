    <h2>We are trying to get each investor private meetings with
      their individual brokers, so they really feel they are being heard,
      and have a say on the placement of their money.
      We know stocks can be confusing for the average citizen, but one meeting
      with a member of our trained team, will make you fully
       understand the investment you have made. You always want
       to know where your money is at. Ask your broker to see
       your investment tracker, and you can view all the companies
        your money is invested in.
